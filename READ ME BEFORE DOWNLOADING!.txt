Hi There!, Before You Download You Need To Know How To Play.
But Before That THIS REPOSITORY IS ONLY FOR WINDOWS Sorry Mac Os X And Linux Users :( .
To Play A Executable Make A Folder On Your Desktop, Name It After The Mod Then Extract The .zip Into Your New Folder And Launch The Game.
To Use Skins And Songs Download The Original Fnf (Here's My Fast Link gg.gg/Fnfalt ) Then Extract The Files Onto Your Desktop (Or Folder If You Want)
And Then Extract The Skin/Song And Delete The File In The Games Files That Has The Same Name As The File In The Skin/Song.
After That Put The Skin/Song Mod In The Assets Folder And Launch The Game.

 Enjoy! :)
